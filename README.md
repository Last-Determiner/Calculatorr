to this date (April/2024) I do not possess knowledge of CSS so I used ChatGPT greatly to design the app
thank to Mr.Ansari for their class and everything they have taught me. Thank your sir

I really tried hard to have floats the way they are in this calculator 
so user won't be allowed to have numbers such as 1.1.1.1.1. or simply only be able to have one dot with disconnect() so user can still use as man as dots but only if floats are seperated with + - * or /

that's it
